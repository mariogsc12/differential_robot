# 📁 hardware/

This folder contains all the hardware-related resources for the robot, including schematics, CAD models, and other design elements.
To view or edit the files in this folder, the following tools may be required:

- **KiCad** – for viewing and editing schematic and PCB design files.
- **Fusion 360** – for editing 2D and 3D CAD models (supports STL, STEP, DXF, etc.).
---

## 📦 Contents

- `design/` – CAD files for the robot structure (for laser cutting, 3D printing, etc.).
- `schematics/` – Circuit diagrams and electrical schematics.

## 🧩 Notes

In my case, I decided to use **wood** for the chassis and manually drill the required holes.  
However, it is also possible to build the same chassis using **3D printed parts**, based on the CAD models provided in the `design/` folder.

Feel free to adapt the design depending on the materials and tools available to you.
